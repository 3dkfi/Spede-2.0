# Spede-2.0
Spede 2.0 is newest revision of the original (and most questionable) Spede -game. Spede game is a whack-a-mole style speedgame. This repository is set up for legendary Hacktoberfest which we take part in yearly to create cool opensource projects.

What is Spede 2.0?
It is a whack-a-mole style cabinet game where you play against other player in intense whacking.
Code can be remixed to include all kinds of different game modes in the system which can be selected via physical switch.

Currently v1.0 version of Spede 2.0 has only 1 game mode:
  - Which player gets first to 50 points win.

What game modes could be coded?
  - Have to points on reverse and you have to hit right buttons to negate 1 point from rivals "lifepool" and there will be a few times in a game that there quickly flashing button beside damage button to get some health back?
  - Some link system to have 2 of these machines be able to combat machine vs. machine?
  - What else? Lets brainstorm different version together :)
